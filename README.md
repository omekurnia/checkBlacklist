# checkBlacklist
Returning boolean of given name and phone number in the blacklist file

This program is created generally with node.js in mind, so make sure you already have node installed on your computer. You also need to install prompt-sync package so you can input name and phone number to be search on the blocked.txt.

To Use :
1. git clone this repository
2. cd into project directory
3. Install prompt-sync package with npm install prompt-sync
4. Run blacklists.js on your terminal with command node blacklists.js
5. Input the name and phone number you want to search
6. The program will return if the number is in the blacklist or not.

Enjoy!

Any suggestion for improvment is really appreciated, thank you for reading.
